Roadmap: Building a Semi-Automated Coding Assistant (MVP) using OpenRouter and PC Burner
Goal: Build an MVP-level semi-automated system for your project, integrating OpenRouter (Cline) and Windows/WSL, while focusing on practical results and avoiding overengineering.

Stage 1: Foundation Setup
1. Environment Preparation (2 sessions, 1-2 hours each)
Session 1: Configure the Development Environment
Install Prerequisites:

Python 3.8+.
Git (for code versioning).
OpenRouter API access:
Sign up at OpenRouter.ai and get your API key.
[Optional] Install WSL if you plan to use a Linux-like environment:
Follow Microsoft’s WSL setup guide.
Set Up Project Workspace:

Create a dedicated project folder (e.g., C:\cline-mvp).
Clone Cline GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/cline/cline.git
Session 2: Install Dependencies
Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional):

In PowerShell/WSL:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
Install Required Libraries:

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure OpenRouter API:

Add your API key to a .env file:
makefile
Copy code
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Test the Basic Setup:

Run Cline locally to check it works:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Access the local server (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
Time Estimation: 4 hours (2 sessions).

Stage 2: Basic CI/CD Integration
2. Automate Core CI/CD Tasks (3 sessions, 1-2 hours each)
Session 3: Create Basic CI/CD Pipeline
Set up GitHub Actions for your repository:
Create .github/workflows/main.yml:
yaml
Copy code
name: CI Pipeline
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run Tests
        run: pytest
Push this to your repository to enable CI.
Session 4: Automate Dependency Management
Configure Dependabot in GitHub to handle package updates:
Add a dependabot.yml file under .github:
yaml
Copy code
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
Set up Cline to verify dependency updates:
Add a custom script for compatibility checks:
python
Copy code
import os
def check_dependencies():
    os.system("pip install --upgrade pip")
    os.system("pip list --outdated > outdated.txt")
    # Logic to analyze compatibility can go here
Session 5: Linting and Formatting
Add a Python linter (e.g., pylint, flake8) and formatter (black):
Install them:
bash
Copy code
pip install pylint black
Configure pre-commit hooks using pre-commit:
bash
Copy code
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
Example .pre-commit-config.yaml:
yaml
Copy code
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: stable
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8
    rev: stable
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
Time Estimation: 6 hours (

3 sessions).

Stage 3: Semi-Automation with Cline
3. Integrate Cline for Semi-Automation (4 sessions, 1-2 hours each)
Session 6: Commanding Cline via API
Explore Cline's API capabilities:

Test simple tasks like "Refactor the following code..." using Python scripts:
python
Copy code
import requests

API_URL = "http://localhost:5000/api"
task = {"task": "Refactor this code", "code": "print('Hello World')"}
response = requests.post(f"{API_URL}/tasks", json=task)
print(response.json())
Automate routine tasks:

Write scripts for tasks like:
Dependency updates.
Refactoring.
Analyzing specific files for improvements.
Session 7: Workflow Orchestration
Use a task scheduler (e.g., cron in WSL, Windows Task Scheduler):
Automate scripts to run every night or after each commit.
Example Windows Task Scheduler command:
cmd
Copy code
python C:\cline-mvp\automation_script.py
Session 8: Refine Outputs
Configure Cline’s outputs to ensure quality:

Add safeguards:
Run automated tests after each task.
Save suggestions to a file for review rather than immediate application.
Log results for manual review:

Example:
python
Copy code
with open("cline_log.txt", "a") as log:
    log.write(response.json())
Session 9: MVP Testing
Select a small codebase as a test project.
Let Cline handle:
Dependency upgrades.
Bug fixes (use Git issues as input).
Code formatting.
Review Cline’s performance and iterate:
What worked?
What failed?
How to improve it?
Time Estimation: 8 hours (4 sessions).

Stage 4: MVP Validation
4. Fine-Tuning and Monitoring (2 sessions, 1-2 hours each)
Session 10: Validation
Test the pipeline with real-world tasks:
Monitor outputs.
Identify bottlenecks.
Adjust automation thresholds:
Which tasks require human intervention vs. full automation?
Session 11: Documentation
Document:
The pipeline.
Usage instructions.
Future improvement areas.
Time Estimation: 4 hours (2 sessions).

Summary
Estimated Total Time: 22-26 hours (10-13 sessions)
Environment Setup: 4 hours.
CI/CD Pipeline: 6 hours.
Cline Semi-Automation: 8 hours.
Validation & Documentation: 4 hours.
Critical Points and Good Practices
Start Small: Build a minimum viable pipeline and add complexity only as needed.
Prioritize Results: Automate the most repetitive, time-consuming tasks first (e.g., dependency updates).
Iterate: Test, improve, and expand as you gather feedback.
Avoid Overengineering: Focus on tangible results rather than perfection
